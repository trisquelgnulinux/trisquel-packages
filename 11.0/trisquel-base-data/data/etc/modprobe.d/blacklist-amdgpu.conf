# The amdgpu kernel module does not load properly unless nonfree firmware
# is installed. The graphics system works correctly (although with no 2D/3D
# acceleration) when the module is blacklisted.
# More information: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-radeon.conf
#
# The module has been left in place as our limited tests do not prove that
# it fails for every existing card model. If you enable it and it works please
# report it at trisquel-devel@listas.trisquel.info
#
# The Trisquel project does not recommend installing nonfree firmware.
# If you do so by your own choice, do not request help on how to install or
# on troubleshooting the resulting setup on the Trisquel forums,  mailing
# lists, irc or any other support channels.
