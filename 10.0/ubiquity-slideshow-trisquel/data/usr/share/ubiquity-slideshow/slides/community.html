<p>Now that you are a Trisquel user we welcome you to join our growing community too. <a href="https://trisquel.info/user/register">Registered</a> users can discuss in the forums, edit the Wiki pages, help translate the site, send bugs and suggestions, pledge on crowdfunded tasks and much more.</p>

<p>If you are a hacker we would also like you to help develop Trisquel. There are many tasks to do, so not only programmers, maintainers, webmasters and sysadmins are welcome, but also translators, designers, betatesters, etc.</p>

<p>So as you see, anyone would have the skills to help in some way, but if you lack the time you can still contribute by becoming a <a href="https://trisquel.info/member">member</a> or by making <a href="https://trisquel.info/donate">donations</a>. You can also help a lot by spreading Trisquel through social networks, publications and free software events.</p>
